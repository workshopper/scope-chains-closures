# Global Scope & Shadowing

## Global Scope

Understanding where Scope Chains end is an important part of scoping. All
Javascript runtimes must implicitly create a _Global Scope_ object (`window` in
the browser, `global` in node), which sits at the top of every scope chain:

```
    (global)
       ↑
       |
   someFunc()
       ↑
      / \
     /   \
    /     \
inner()  inner2()
           ↑
           |
         foo()
```

In _Scopes_ we covered how usage of `var` or `let` dictates the scope of the
variable being defined. When assigning a variable without using either of `var`,
`let`, etc, the variable is assumed to exist in an outer scope.

The javascript runtime follows these steps to assign a variable:

 1) Search within the current scope.
 2) If not found, search in the immediately outer scope.
 3) If found, go to 6.
 4) If not found, repeat 2 and 3 until the Global Scope is reached.
 5) If not found in Global Scope, create it (on `window` / `global` objects).
 6) Assign the value.

In this way, it is possible to accidentally define a global variable (step 5).

### Example Global Scope

Consider the following example:

```js
function someFunc() {
   var scopedVar = 1;
   function inner() {
      foo = 2;
   }
}
```

Note the lack of `var` or `let`, etc for `foo = 2`. The Javascript runtime will
follow the above algorithm, first checking the scope of `inner()`, then of
`someFunc()`, then finally the Global Scope. Step 5 is then executed, so `foo`
becomes a variable in the Global Scope (`window.foo` / `global.foo`).

Phrased another way: By accidentally forgetting to use `var`, the variable `foo`
which otherwise would have been only within the lexical scope of `inner()` is
now available to be modified by _any_ scope. So, `someFunc()` now has access
where the developer may have meant for it not to.

_Remember: Only inner scopes can access variables of outer scopes. In this case
the `someFunc()` scope is an inner scope of the Global Scope, allowing access of
`foo` to `someFunc()`._

## Shadowing

A variable is created in a 'Step 0)' of the above algorithm: When `var` or `let`
is used. The variable is assigned to the correct scope, then execution moves on,
and any assignments to that variable follow the above algorithm.

It is perfectly valid to define two different variables, in different scopes,
with the same name:

```js
function someFunc() {
   var foo = 1;
}
function anotherFunc() {
   var foo = 2;
}
```

It is also valid to do this in nested scopes:

```js
function someFunc() {
   var foo = 1;
   function inner() {
      var foo = 2;
   }
}
```

This is called _Shadowing_. The `foo` inside `inner()` is said to _Shadow_ the `foo`
inside `someFunc`.

Shadowing means that the `inner()` scope only has access to its own `foo`. There
is no way for it to access the `foo` defined in `someFunc()`.

This can also be an accidental source of bugs, especially when there is deep
nesting, or long functions.

# Your Mission

Starting with your solution from the previous lesson, assign a value to the global variable
`quux` inside `foo()` (don't use `var` or `let`). Create a shadow variable of `quux`
inside `zip()`. The value in the global variable `quux` has to be different than the
value of `quux` inside `zip()`.

Once complete, execute `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify <your-file.js>` to verify your
solution.
